                <b>10. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</b><br><br>

                <i><b>In Short: </b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</i><br><br>
            
                We have implemented an appropriate Information Security Management System (ISMS) designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. This ISMS is established and managed in alignment with global best practices and certified towards ISO 27001:2013 standard. The system is subject to strong controls including ongoing monitoring, periodic security testing, internal/external audits and verifications. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services or Apps is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.

                <i><b>In Short: </b> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</i><br><br>

                We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services or Apps, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services or Apps.

If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@livezy.com">support@livezy.com</a>.

                If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.

                <b>13. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</b><br><br>

                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.
